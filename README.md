This program will not work at all if you start it from a different directory than the one it's in. You have to cd into it's directory and start it from there, or it will crash when you try to select something.

If you don't have the python keyboard module or pygetwindow module, it will need internet the first time it runs.
Just start it, it's pretty self-explanitory once it's running.
If you want to exclude any folders, go to line 66 and change put in the names of the folders you want to exclude.
